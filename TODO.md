# Nice to haves

## Preview card size

Some ideas for allowing resizing:

- Probably easy: Add a "Theater Mode" toggle:
    * When off, determine canvas height by 50% the window height
    * When on, determine canvas height by 100% the window width
    * Bonus: Add easing into that size, use frame count to animate
- Probably harder: drag bottom of card to resize

Try to port over some of the cooler advanced shift types from your Processing version

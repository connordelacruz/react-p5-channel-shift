# Do before beta

## Better laptop layout

- Maybe figure out how to put controls on the left and preview on the right in wide views?
- Scale down snackbar and app bar (also helps with mobile)

## It works on mobile now! Make UI more responsive

- Fix channel chips going out of bounds
- Scale preview image better, it takes up too much space on mobile
- Put text input on its own line on narrow viewports
- Slider accessibility?
- scrollable tabs?
- Re-work randomization options tables to fit better??
- shrink snackbar buttons
- Better app bar scaling
    * hide text on save/load?

# Nice to haves

## Preview card size

Some ideas for allowing resizing:

- Probably easy: Add a "Theater Mode" toggle:
    * When off, determine canvas height by 50% the window height
    * When on, determine canvas height by 100% the window width
    * Bonus: Add easing into that size, use frame count to animate
- Probably harder: drag bottom of card to resize

# Future big features

## Experimental/Advanced filters (or however you wanna phrase it)

Try to port over some of the cooler advanced shift types from your Processing version
